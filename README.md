# Markdown Courses

We maninly use bookdown for courses at our university, however we are constantly on the lookout how other unis use markdown-technologies to distribute their course curriculum (blogdown, distill, rmarkdown, jupyterbooks etc). I had posted this question on (community.rstudio.com)[https://community.rstudio.com/t/blogdown-or-bookdown-for-academic-courses-course-handouts/37621] but I can't comment on this thread, since it is automatically locked. I will therefore use this repo to document bookdown-, blogdown-, distill- jupyterbook based courses that I stumple across.
